Freminal is a fully Rust-based terminal emulator built to prioritize **accuracy**, **speed**, and **aesthetic coherence**.
It aims to be _deeply standards-compliant_ while also embracing modern design ideas — smooth rendering, clear typography,
and a cohesive Catppuccin-inspired visual style.

> “A terminal emulator that feels like it actually understands what you meant.”

## ✨ Features

- **Comprehensive ANSI/DEC/xterm support**
  Full SGR (256 + TrueColor) and most CSI, OSC, and DEC sequences implemented.
  See [Escape Sequence Coverage](./docs/ESCAPE_SEQUENCE_COVERAGE.md) for full details.

- **Modern Rendering Pipeline**
  Built on [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui), tuned for pixel-perfect glyph alignment and efficient draw batching.

- **Mouse & Input Handling**
  Supports mouse tracking modes (?1000–1006) and full keyboard interaction.

- **Alt Screen & Scrollback Buffers**
  True alternate screen behavior, smooth scrolling, and instant context switching.

- **Reproducible Nix Development Environment**
  Deterministic devshells and CI via flakes. One command brings up the full toolchain.

- **Beautiful Catppuccin Theme**
  Default palette matches Catppuccin Mocha. Full theming system planned.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Preferred: Nix / Flake Environment**

If you use [Nix](https://nixos.org) or [direnv](https://direnv.net):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredclausen/freminal.git
cd freminal
direnv allow     # or: nix develop
```

This enters a reproducible dev shell with:

- Rust toolchain (stable) via `rust-overlay`
- `cargo-llvm-cov`, `cargo-machete`, and benchmarking tools
- All required system libraries (libGL, wayland, xkbcommon, etc.)

### 2. **Run the Emulator**

```bash
cargo run --release
```

or, for testing and benchmarking:

```bash
cargo test
cargo bench
```

### 3. **CLI Options**

```text
freminal [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag                          | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--shell <PATH>`              | Shell to run (overrides config file and default shell)         |
| `--config <PATH>`             | Path to a TOML config file (overrides default config search)   |
| `--recording-path <PATH>`     | Path to write session recordings to                            |
| `--write-logs-to-file[=BOOL]` | Write logs to a file in the current directory (default: false) |
| `--show-all-debug`            | Show all debug output (disables default log filtering)         |
| `--help`                      | Print help                                                     |
| `--version`                   | Print version                                                  |

Configuration is loaded from a layered set of TOML files (system, user, env var), then
overridden by `--config` if specified, and finally by individual CLI flags. See
[`config_example.toml`](./config_example.toml) for all available settings.

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Uses `cargo xtask` for CI and build orchestration.
- Test coverage targets **100 %** across crates (`cargo llvm-cov`).
- Profiling and benchmarking via `cargo bench` and `samply`.
- CI runs inside Nix with full caching through [Cachix](https://cachix.org).

## 🖌️ Theming

The default color palette is **Catppuccin Mocha**, chosen for its readability and aesthetic warmth.
Theme customization will become user-configurable in a future release.

| Example         | Catppuccin Mocha |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Background      | `#1E1E2E`        |
| Foreground      | `#CDD6F4`        |
| Accent (Cursor) | `#89B4FA`        |

## 🧩 Project Goals

- Match or exceed **xterm** escape sequence compatibility.
- Achieve sub-millisecond average frame times during scrollback rendering.
- Provide full Nix-based build reproducibility.
- Serve as a reference-grade open terminal emulator written in idiomatic Rust.
